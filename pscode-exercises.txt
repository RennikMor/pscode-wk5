// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num % 2
if result is 0 then number is even
if result is 1 then number is odd

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers together
